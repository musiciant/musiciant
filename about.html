        <h2 class="title">About Musiciant</h2>
        <p>Musiciant is a partnership online music store established by
            <br>Musiciant Co., a music-focused company owned and operated
            <br>by Kyle Rodriguez and Angelou Salvador in the Philippines.
            <br>The store offers a variety of high-quality music appliances
            <br>and albums suitable for teens, young adults and simply for any
            <br>fan of music. The trend for albums (especially K-Pop and Western ones)
            <br>has been undeniably growing over the past year. However, music is for
            <br>everyone to revel in and Musiciant is here to fulfill
            <br>that entertainment. 
            <br>
            <br>In the Philippines, reliable online music appliance stores
            <br>are limited. This is one of the reasons why the company was formed
            <br>for pursuing the idea of opening an online store and also because
            <br>of the creators' dreams to connect more people to music.
            <br>
            <br>Musiciant aims to be the best music appliance and
            <br>musical instruments store in the Philippines.

        <img src="images/Kyle.jpg" width="100%">
        <h2>Kyle Mc Leandrey Rodriguez</h2>
        <h4>Creator</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            As a patient of acute bronchial asthma, Kyle grew up around computers
            <br>and musical instruments, both becoming the center of his hobbies. His
            <br>aspirations were technology-centric when he was younger, but he began
            <br>to love music more as he grew up and considered it as one of his
            <br>career paths. Stepping into college led him to be more practical,
            <br>taking Computer Science as his bachelor course. However, regardless
            <br>of what road he is driving his way onto right now, he is certain of
            <br>one thing: he will never give up music, and he would still aim to
            <br>be a musician in his lifetime, whenever that may be in the future.

        <h2>Angelou Salvador</h2>
        <h4>Creator</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            Born and raised in a household full of love for music, Angelou learned 
            <br>to play the flute at the age of 7. She grew up listening to a variety 
            <br>of music genres, and until now, she kept on exploring. She didn't 
            <br>pursue a college degree related to music and instead chose a degree in 
            <br>which she thought would help nourish her career in the future. 
            <br>Music has always been a source of entertainment and her means to 
            <br>relax during pastimes. It will always be a part of her life and she 
            <br>aims to expand her reach to connect people to music by utilizing her 
            <br>knowledge.
